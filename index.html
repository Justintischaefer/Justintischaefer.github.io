    	<p style="color:blue;">My name is Justin Tischaefer and I am a student at UW-Madison. I am currently a Junior and my major is Electrical Engineering. This website is to show some of my interests and various aspects of my life. Included are some hobbies, a reading list, and some music that I listen to. I hope that this website provides some insight into who I am and introduces you to the things that are important to me.
